Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is the central control system that is connected to GitHub, allowing us to track changes in code,
collaborate on files and projects, and manage multiple versions of a project. Since we're going to have a large
group project this semester, using Git allows each group to collaborate on their own datasets and code while
being organized and keeping up with each other's code pushes and updates.
