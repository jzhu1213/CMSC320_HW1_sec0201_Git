Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is the central control system that is connected to GitHub, allowing us to track changes in code,
collaborate on files and projects, and manage multiple versions of a project. Since we're going to have a large
group project this semester, using Git allows each group to collaborate on their own datasets and code while
being organized and keeping up with each other's code pushes and updates.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be heavily applied to a field like finance, especially when examining the stock market.
Bankers and investors can use data science to analyze trends and patterns in stocks and use the information gathered
to make smart financial decisions. Whether machine learning or creating models, finance professionals can use
data science for anything in market prediction analysis.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging creates a new merge commit without entirely rewriting over all the existing code, keeping the branch 
history intact. Rebasing overwrites your code and history, so your most recent commit is what will be shown.
